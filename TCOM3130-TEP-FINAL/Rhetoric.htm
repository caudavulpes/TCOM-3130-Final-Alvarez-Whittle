  <h1 class="display-4">Rhetoric</h1>
  <p class="lead">While a variety of important rhetorical and ethical approaches are used in TCOM. Aristotle’s definition of rhetoric as “the ability to perceive the available means of persuasion” is an ideal definition for technical communicators. This definition does not reduce rhetoric to “the art of persuasion,” instead it offers the students of rhetoric an enhanced ability to understand, design, and communicate with their audience. Implementing rhetoric in the field of TCOM was considerably difficult for its early practitioners, who were opposed by much of the Old Guard who maintained outmoded forms of communicating.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>
The earlier methods of technical communication focused on communication information in the most objective manner possible. Incredibly dry language, often feigned objectivity, was the standard practice. Those using these artifacts of technical communication found them increasingly difficult to use. They often provided inadequate context and failed to consider the specific needs of their audience. Asking basic questions about the end-user, circumstances they would use the information in, decisions they would make using the information, and similar questions meant more effective communication. </p>
<p>The need for this communication became clearer with unfortunate and tragic events that could have been prevented with communication that properly considered the needs of their audience.
As rhetoric has become a significant part of TCOM, branches aside from technical writing and information design have begun to flourish for technical communicators. The fields of interactive design and user experience are deeply connected, some would argue interwoven, with technical communication as part of the whole. Interactive design requires an understanding of the way users’ approach and attempt to make use of a product, whether the product is for physical or digital applications. User experience is also chiefly concerned with the audience it addresses. User experience developers directly interact with samples of their audience to obtain highly valuable feedback. That feedback is used to generate better products that cause less user error and frustration, leading to streamlined and intuitive design that is both functional and pleasing to interact with.
These fields specialize in communicating technical information using other mediums but hold rhetoric to be just as valuable to clear and effective communication and design. Rhetoric also plays a key role in front-end and SEO practices and information architecture. Tags and taxonomies help sort information into expected formats that are accessible to a specific audience. Developing intuitive labels to sort information on a website, database, library, or other information repository is an essential part of organizing complex and layered information.
