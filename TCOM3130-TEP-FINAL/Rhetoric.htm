Technical communicators called for the addition to rhetoric and ethics to TCOM long before the Challenger disaster brought the United States to a mourning state. While several different ethical systems had been offered by the TCOM community, Aristotle’s definition of rhetoric remained primary (Miller 1979). As he defined it, rhetoric is the ability to perceive the available means of persuasion. Note that rhetoric is not described as “the art of persuasion” or “the art of speech.” Rightly understood, rhetoric is the discipline of understanding everything that can persuade the audience. Rhetoric must then be a discipline chiefly interested in understanding the audience and communicating effectively to them.      </p>

    Tools and skill sets are by their nature, without a moral inclination — they simply exist and can be wielded to any effect. Rhetoric is one such tool. Looking back on technical communication in WW2 there are salient examples of applying ethical and rhetorical devices for dishonest purposes (Ward Sr 2010). White papers removed words indicating human involvement in the use of equipment (Katz 1992). This was done to prevent the conscience of their fellows from being troubled by their actions. The failure of NASA’s Challenger mission could have been prevented with the right application of rhetoric or ethic.

    Applying these tools to honest efforts produces remarkable results. Those requesting clear and actionable information are likely to obtain what is necessary to achieve their goal. Perhaps more importantly these tools foster more capable technical communicators. Wider skillsets that involve designing information for specific purposes are taught. TCOM now involves understanding all the skills that surround creating highly usable content for any audience (Bourelle, Bourelle, Jones 2015).

  As rhetoric has become a significant part of TCOM, branches aside from technical writing and information design have begun to flourish for technical communicators. The fields of interactive design and user experience are deeply connected, some would argue interwoven, with technical communication as part of the whole. Interactive design requires an understanding of the way users’ approach and attempt to make use of a product, whether the product is for physical or digital applications.

  User experience is also chiefly concerned with the audience it addresses. User experience developers directly interact with samples of their audience to obtain highly valuable feedback. That feedback is used to generate better products that cause less user error and frustration, leading to streamlined and intuitive design that is both functional and pleasing to interact with (Kostelnick 2007).
</p>
<p>
These fields specialize in communicating technical information using other mediums but hold rhetoric to be just as valuable to clear and effective communication and design. Rhetoric also plays a key role in front-end and SEO practices and information architecture. Tags and taxonomies help sort information into expected formats that are accessible to a specific audience. Developing intuitive labels to sort information on a website, database, library, or other information repository is an essential part of organizing complex and layered information.
