  <h1 class="dify-4">Ethics</h1>
  <p class="lead">The role of ethics in the field of Technical Communication is very influential on the way that messages are communicated. When we consider Technical Communication’s responsibility to instruct readers, ethical decision making becomes both a concern to the author as well as the audience. The author’s focus is to instruct and not manipulate users into completing a task and reaching an end. The audience is tasked with critically analyzing the ethics of a Technical Documents rhetoric, understandability, and intent. </p>

    <section>  <li>Consequentalisst Ethics</li> <p>Consequentialist ethics are conscious of the potential results of taking a course of action. Ethical decision making requires understanding more than just personal deliberation but potential outcomes of deciding one way over another. Consequentialist ethics account for more than the human experience to include eco-systems. </p>

    <section>  <li>Expedient Ethics</li> <p>Extreme case sampling of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws flyers is an example of the role of ethics in information design and communication. Rhetorically analyzing the technical documents used by Nazis during the holocaust in order to identify the effect of using rhetoric as a means to an end without regard to consequence or humanity. This rhetoric is coined the rhetoric of expediency.</p>
    </section>
    <section>  <li>Humanist Ethics</li> <p>Communication takes place between people.
Humanism values the human perspective over all else. Humanism is central for effectively identifying and empathizing with the audience. Communicators can better understand and advocate for user’s needs by adopting rhetoric centered around humanist ethics.</p>
