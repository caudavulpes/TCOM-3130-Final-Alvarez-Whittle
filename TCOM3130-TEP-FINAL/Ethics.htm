  <h1 class="display-4">Ethics</h1>
  <p><div>“Under this communalist perspective, the teaching of technical or scientific writing becomes more than the inculcation of a set of skills; it becomes a kind of enculturation. We can teach technical or scientific writing, not as a set of techniques for accommodating slippery words to intractable things, but as an understanding of how to belong to a community.”
  -	(Miller, 1979)</div></p>

  <p class="lead">The role of ethics in the field of Technical Communication is very influential on the way that messages are communicated. When we consider Technical Communication’s responsibility to instruct readers, ethical decision making becomes both a concern to the author as well as the audience. The author’s focus is to instruct and not manipulate users into completing a task and reaching an end. The audience is tasked with critically analyzing the ethics of a Technical Documents rhetoric, understandability, and intent. </p>

    <section>  <li>Consequentalist Ethics</li> <p>Consequentialist ethics are conscious of the potential results of taking a course of action. Ethical decision making requires understanding more than just personal deliberation but potential outcomes of deciding one way over another. Consequentialist ethics account for more than the human experience to include eco-systems. </p>
    </section>
    <section>  <li>Expedient Ethics</li> <p>Extreme case sampling of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws flyers is an example of the role of ethics in information design and communication. Rhetorically analyzing the technical documents used by Nazis during the holocaust in order to identify the effect of using rhetoric as a means to an end without regard to consequence or humanity. This rhetoric is coined the rhetoric of expediency.</p>
    </section>
    <section>  <li>Humanist Ethics</li> <p>Communication takes place between people.
Humanism values the human perspective over all else. Humanism is central for effectively identifying and empathizing with the audience. Communicators can better understand and advocate for user’s needs by adopting rhetoric centered around humanist ethics.</p>

        <h2>Communalist Perspective</h2>
        <div class="">
        <p> The communal perspective is introduced in Miller’s, “A Humanistic Rationale for Technical Writing”. The communal perspective goes hand in hand with humanism since it asks technical communicators to consider the experience of the user as well as the feedback and data of other technical communicators in order to better create clarity for the audience.</p>

<p>The benefits of collaboration in the field of TCOM is not only beneficial but also essential. Technical Communicators are not always directly involved in the development of a piece of technology or legislation yet it is their job to understand it well enough to communicate the instructions and uses of the item to a large audience. It is the user research and user testing that helps technical communicators identify what areas to focus on when creating a technical document. This exchange of information between tester and observer is the type of collaboration that Miller discusses in  “A Humanistic Rationale for Technical Writing”.</p>
<p>Beyond that, technical communicators also need to learn to work with the engineers and development teams. Though the relationship between engineers is rocky due to the aforementioned division of scientific knowledge and rhetorical knowledge held by most, the communalist perspective is a method of overcoming this collaborative obstacle in order to better service and advocate for the user. We will further discuss the role of Technical Communicators in the workplace under applications.</p>
