  <h1 class="display-4">Technical communication is the process of designing or expressing content that interprets, instructs, or translates information for use by a specific audience.</h1>
  <p class="lead">The public idea of technical forms of writing are focused on
    the emphasis of scientific knowledge over rhetorical. Many active Technical
    Communicators have found that acknowledging the  existence of both in the
    teaching methods of Technical Communication are useful in developing a
    multimodal pedagogy. With todayâ€™s advancements in communication technologies
     in mind, multimodal forms of communication are common occurrences.
     These new methods of transmitting messages increase the need for Technical
     Communicators in all facets of life. </p>
     <h1>Design Thinking</h1>
     <p>Design thinking is a five-step process for solving user challenges by
       iteratively testing the solution. Anything from a wet floor sign to a
       traffic light is meant to communicate the same message to not just
       yourself but the whole population as well. How can we identify the most
       effective means of communication for an audience greater than 0?  User
       centered design is best for innovating beyond the direct user-interface.</p>
     <h1>User-Centered Design VS Design Thinking</h1>
     <p>User-centered design differs from design-thinking in that it is more applied and devoted to the user interface experience. It aims at researching and testing specifics like usability, accessibility, and understandability. Both methods are commonly used throughout Technical Communication since both equally value the customer/audience at the forefront of any solution strategy.</p>
