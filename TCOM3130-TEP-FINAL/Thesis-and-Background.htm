The common view of technical communication (TCOM) is somewhat vague. When asked the question “What is technical communication?” the response is always different. Replies almost always indicate that TCOM is focused on dry scientific or technical details. Contemporary technical communicators will say that there is truth in that claim. However, it is not the whole truth and perhaps not the majority truth that would satisfy technical communicators as an accurate definition.   </p>

    The common view of technical communication (TCOM) is somewhat vague. When asked the question “What is technical communication?” the response is always different. Replies almost always indicate that TCOM is focused on dry scientific or technical details. Contemporary technical communicators will say that there is truth in that claim. However, it is not the whole truth and perhaps not the majority truth that would satisfy technical communicators as an accurate definition.
    <p></p>
    Defining TCOM requires defining what it does and who is receiving the action, the audience. Could then, technical communication be described as a discipline that communicates scientific and technical knowledge to an audience?
    <p></p>
    While the definition has a greater degree of truth than the most common definitions, it leaves out specificity. There is too much room for ambiguous action that could be considered TCOM that, is not. The discipline has layered and adopted skill sets, techniques, philosophies, and ethics over the millennia. Present day technical communicators have adopted the use of rhetoric – per Aristotle’s definition – as a guiding principle of understanding their audience. Through trials and tragedy, tech com practitioners have settled on placing rhetoric at a place of high importance within their discipline.
    </p>
  <p>
Committing to this decision has changed TCOM. It opened a whole field of designing information – writing, infographics, coding, and other forms of content. Technical communication is flourishing as a result and is more important now than it has ever been. A more accurate definition of TCOM is, technical communication is the process of designing or expressing content that interprets, instructs, or translates information for use by a specific audience.    </p>
