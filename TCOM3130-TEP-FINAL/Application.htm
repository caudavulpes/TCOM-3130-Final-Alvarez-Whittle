  <h1 class="display-4">Technical Communication in the real world.</h1>
  <p class="lead"> We are more digital now than ever before and continue to adapt to more constraints using technology. It is our job as technical communicators to facilitate the methods of overcoming user constraints and issues by applying user centered design strategies into understandable technical documents.
</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
<section>  <p>There are many applications to Technical Communication in the workplace. Everyday tasks like memos and e-mails require insight into the audience you are interacting with. Factors like corporate culture and design constraints may influence the rhetoric you use to communicate with your audience. The ability to consciously consider the effective means of persuasion with your audience and through which medium is effectively a major workplace necessity. Though the ever-growing
   information society has begun to influence the workplace as form, it cannot shape the way it functions.  </p>
  <p>Jobs like Uber and GrubHub delivery seem like the initiation of a major shift. Working from home all semester has prepared me for what to expect as the transfer to a gig-economy begins shifting the job landscape in the future. COVID made companies aware of the ability to work from home. Technical Communication not only prepares you for issues like these but also helps you identify strategies to solve them.</p>
