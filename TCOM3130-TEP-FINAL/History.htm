  <h1 class="display-4">History</h1>
  <p class="lead">Technical communication (TCOM) is among the oldest forms of transferring knowledge or expertise to an audience for the purpose of accomplishing a task. The very first complicated tasks would have required communication of a highly specific nature. Indeed, technical communication may be found across all ancient civilizations around the world.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Their ability to communicate this information ensured the knowledge discovered in a lifetime would pass to the next generation and continue improving.
As humans mastered materials in the Bronze and Iron ages, technical communication became more sophisticated, taking the form of engineering documents and treatises on many subjects. The West experience an explosion of technical communication during the Renaissance, First Industrial Revolution, and Second Industrial Revolution. Each period, particularly the last in the middle 19th Century produced staggering volumes of technical communication.
The creation of the academic journal, agricultural and mechanical universities, and a technology obsessed world proved catalytic for technical writing. Early Sears and Roebuck catalogs show index numbers that were used for ordering, sorting, and shipping. Customers could use these documents to order anything from nails and rivets to wagons or steam engine parts.
</p>
<p>The United State began producing incredible amounts of technical documentation as a new world of technologies such as electricity, railways, mass manufacturing, interchangeable parts, telegraphs, and inexpensive printing came together. Throughout the 20th century technical communication took on elements of information design that included detailed graphs and charts while it matured. The world wars, particularly WW2, generated impressive new volumes of technical documentation as technical communicators began to concern themselves more with fulfilling the needs of their audience.
Technical communicators during the WW2 era produced documentation that forced them to consider their audience’s needs directly. Some technical writers compiled training manuals for pilots; these manuals had to instruct future pilots on correct procedures for take-off, landing, and aerial maneuvers. Without deeply considering the communication of this information to their specific audience, these exercises could have easily led to disastrous consequences. Numerous similar circumstances in industry and growing questions within the academic community helped spur the next stage of development in technical communication.
Post world wars, technical communicators began shifting the focus of the discipline from communicating “just the facts” to considering the specific needs of a specific audience. The introduction of rhetoric to technical communication injected new life into the discipline. Audience-centered design encouraged technical communicators to design and communicate using a wide array of mediums. Technical communicators are now deeply tied to information design, user experience, usability, information architecture, technical writing, and several other flourishing fields of design and communication.
