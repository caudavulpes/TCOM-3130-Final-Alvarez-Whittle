  <h1 class="display-4">History</h1>
  <p class="lead">
  Technical communication has been around for thousands of years. It first appears with written information in early civilizations around the planet. The practice of communicating complex information through speech predates the earliest societies and is widely practiced today in contemporary civilizations. TCOM has been essential to the development of technology, economic, legal, engineering practices. Documenting and improving these skills and traditions shaped technical communication into a powerful genre.
  </p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <h2>Explosive Growth</h2>
    <p></p>
    Western history records periods rich in technical documentation, in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages. Great eruptions of technical communication occurred in Europe during the Renaissance (Connaster 2007). Moveable type printing presses and a new world of technologies promoted the creation of illustrations and text to accompany them. Academies, monasteries, and universities contributed significantly to this growing body of media.
    <p></p>
    The next chapters of explosive growth began with the First (1760-1820) and Second (1870-WWI Era) Industrial Revolutions. Each era produced mechanical wonders and inventions beyond the imagination of their previous generation. Whole industries of printing and communication sprang up overnight to match the frenzied pace of invention. During the Second Industrial Revolution the critical advancements of academic or scientific journals and agricultural and mechanical (A&M) or technical colleges (Connaster 2007).
    <p></p>
    Early Sears and Roebuck catalogs from this era were indexing products with serial numbers. These numbers helped customers order products by mail or telegraph. Sears use the serial numbers for storing, retrieving, and invoicing customers. Their products were sent by railway to nearly any part of the country. The groundwork for our current economy was in place during the second industrial revolution. The increase in sophistication placed an equal and opposite demand for information and instruction.
    <p></p>
    This is an early pivot towards the future of technical communication. Technical documentation was being made for and used by those without a technical expertise. The creators of Sears and Roebuck catalog had to consider first their audience. Who would read the catalog, and would they understand it enough to be comfortable using it to purchase expensive things? This simple pivot foreshadows the introduction of rhetoric to technical communication.
<p></p>
<h2>The World At War</h2>
  The First World War marked the end of the Second Industrial Revolution. The Second World War (WW2) created a more dire workshop for the technical communicator. The world was at war and it was no longer plausible for soldiers to simply drill with their arms and technologies. The machines of war required operators with intimate knowledge of the systems in play. Gone were the days of biplanes, cavalry charges, and battle lines. War became a largely technical enterprise that required planning and orchestration of forces moving together on a multi-continental scale.
  <p></p>
The large-scale considerations of WW2 certainly brought challenges to technical communicators, who helped create military intelligence reports, films, and radio communiques. Theater-wide plans for invasion were researched on the ground and in the air by reconnaissance teams who served as subject matter experts. Recon teams were then interviewed, and formal reports were created which served as a basis for drafting the plans that General Eisenhower, Bradley, or Patton (in the West) would review to plan their strategies.
The small-scale elements of the war were just as thoroughly immersed in TCOM. Aircraft pilots, tank operators, mechanics, sailors, and soldiers all received various amounts of literature throughout the war on their vessels, technology, and armaments. Many of these documents instructed for use, providing readers with usability instructions, alternate, and contingency actions for successful operation. Technical communication came face to face with an important law of communication: audience first. TCOM is no different. Following WW2 technical communicators began to understand that who they were communicating with was fundamentally as important as the message itself
<p></p>
<h2>Modern and Contemporary</h2>
  Post WW2 technical communicators began an important dialogue in academic journals. At the same time, many in industry recognized a need for effective technical communication. Both groups saw adherence to communication standards that emerged from empiricism. This style focused on using exacting, objective language, and the appearance of perfect neutrality (Kostelnick 2007). While this style of communication may have served niche technical communities, the dialogue pressed, it was not suitable for the emerging Information Age.
  <p></p>
  Several important dialogues arose from these papers, including critical examinations of ethics and application. Technical communicators, they argued, should be introduced to the study of rhetoric. Rhetoric is a discipline chiefly concerned with understanding and communicating to an audience. TCOM, the assertion went, must be more than communicating technical information accurately – it must be highly usable and decrease possible errors from the end user.
  <p></p>
  Though the discussion would grow in volume and have success, a grim tragedy brought the need to adopt the study of rhetoric – and ethics – home. January 28, 1986 marks the disaster involving the Challenger space shuttle. Approximately 17 percent of Americans saw the events unfold on live television as the shuttle broke apart in and explosion 73 seconds into its flight. Media coverage of the disaster ensured more than 80% of the country heard of the events within an hour.
  <p></p>
  The Rogers Commission was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to investigate the accident. NASA’s organizational culture was a primary factor, particularly in disregarding warnings from the engineers. The examination revealed issues in communication and ethics. While the Morton-Thiokol engineers and technical communicators warned of the catastrophic design flaw in the O-rings used in the Challenger, they did not communicate properly to ensure NASA would abort the launch (Driskill 1989). Rhetoric and ethics quickly moved to the forefront of TCOM education and practice.
